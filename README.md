Data Structures.
Description

Data Structures are specialized ways of organizing and storing data in memory so that operations like access, insertion, deletion, and search can be performed efficiently.

Choosing the correct data structure directly affects the performance and scalability of software applications.

They are fundamental to:

Algorithm design

Problem solving

System design

Competitive programming

Technical interviews

Why Data Structures Matter

Efficient data structures help to:

Reduce time complexity

Optimize memory usage

Improve code clarity

Handle large datasets effectively

Every algorithm depends on how data is structured.

Categories of Data Structures
Linear Data Structures

Elements are arranged sequentially.

Array

Dynamic Array

Linked List

Stack

Queue

Deque

Non-Linear Data Structures

Elements are arranged hierarchically or interconnected.

Tree

Binary Tree

Binary Search Tree (BST)

Heap

Graph

Trie

Hash-Based Structures

Hash Table

Map

Set

Time Complexity Overview
Data Structure	Access	Search	Insertion	Deletion
Array	O(1)	O(n)	O(n)	O(n)
Linked List	O(n)	O(n)	O(1)*	O(1)*
Stack	O(n)	O(n)	O(1)	O(1)
Queue	O(n)	O(n)	O(1)	O(1)
Hash Table	O(1)**	O(1)**	O(1)**	O(1)**
Binary Search Tree	O(log n)***	O(log n)***	O(log n)***	O(log n)***

* If reference is known
** Average case
*** Balanced BST

Relationship With Algorithms

Data Structures + Algorithms = Efficient Programs

Example:

Binary Search requires a sorted array.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm requires a priority queue (heap).

BFS requires a queue.

DFS requires a stack (or recursion).

Goals of This Repository

Practice implementing data structures from scratch

Understand internal memory behavior
