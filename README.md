What Are Data Structures?

A data structure is a systematic way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

It defines how data is arranged in memory and how operations are performed on that data.

Data structures are independent of programming languages and can be implemented in any language.

Why Data Structures Are Important

Data structures are fundamental to computer science. They determine:

Program performance and efficiency

Memory usage

Scalability for large inputs

Ease of implementation

Maintainability of code

Choosing the right data structure can drastically improve performance and reduce resource usage.
